# How to See Every Record in Detail (Mazdoor got this on this date, etc.)

The app is built so you can **see any record clearly** and **control it easily**: list → click **View** → see a **one-line summary** (e.g. "Mazdoor Ahmed got 8,000 on 15 Jan 2025") plus full details.

---

## 1. What you see in the list

- **Payments, Expenses, Transactions:** Each row has an **"Added by"** column (who recorded it).
- **Daily Cash Memo, Labour, Labour Expenses:** Each row has a **View** button so you can open that record’s details.

---

## 2. One-line summary in detail view

When you click **View**, the top of the detail shows a **single sentence** so you know exactly what the record is:

| Page / record | Example summary you’ll see |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Payments** (mazdoor) | *Mazdoor Ahmed received 8,000 from Bank on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Payments** (supplier) | *Supplier ABC received 8,000 from account on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Payments** (other) | *Payment of 8,000 to [name] from [account] on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Receipts** | *Received 8,000 from [name] into [account] on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Expenses** (mazdoor) | *Mazdoor Ahmed got 8,000 on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Expenses** (supplier) | *Supplier ABC — 8,000 on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Expenses** (other) | *Electricity of 8,000 on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Daily Cash Memo** (entry) | *Ahmed — 8,000 (Cash in) on Daily Cash Memo for 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Labour** (record) | *Labour Ahmed — 10 bags × PKR 50 = PKR 500 on 15 Jan 2025.* |
| **Labour Expenses** (rate) | *Labour expense Ahmed — rate PKR 50 per unit.* |

Below that, the same screen shows **full details** (amount, date, description, account, category, notes, recorded by, etc.) and **Close** / **Edit** so you can control the record easily.
